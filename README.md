The Ignition System Control project aims to design and implement an advanced ignition control system using Arduino microcontrollers. Traditional ignition systems lack the flexibility and precision required to optimize performance under varying operating conditions. Therefore, this project leverages Arduino's capabilities to develop a sophisticated ignition timing mechanism capable of dynamically adjusting timing based on real-time inputs from engine sensors. The objectives include designing breakout boxes tailored to specific electronic control units (ECUs), experimenting with function generators and oscilloscopes to validate the ignition control mechanism, and evaluating system performance in terms of engine efficiency, fuel consumption, and emissions reduction. The methodology involves requirement analysis, system design, breakout box manufacturing, prototype development, experimentation, and performance evaluation. The results demonstrate significant improvements in fuel economy and emissions reduction, highlighting the effectiveness of the ignition control system in optimizing engine performance.
